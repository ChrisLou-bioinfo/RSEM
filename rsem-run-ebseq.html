<p>This file is a m by n matrix. m is the number of genes/transcripts and n is the number of total samples. Each element in the matrix represents the expected count for a particular gene/transcript in a particular sample. Users can use 'rsem-generate-data-matrix' to generate this file from expression result files.</p>

<p>Comma-separated list of values representing the number of replicates for each condition. For example, &quot;3,3&quot; means the data set contains 2 conditions and each condition has 3 replicates. &quot;2,3,3&quot; means the data set contains 3 conditions, with 2, 3, and 3 replicates for each condition respectively.</p>

<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This program is a wrapper over EBSeq. It performs differential expression analysis and can work on two or more conditions. All genes/transcripts and their associated statistcs are reported in one output file. This program does not control false discovery rate and call differential expressed genes/transcripts. Please use 'rsem-control-fdr' to control false discovery rate after this program is finished.</p>
<p>
</p>

<h1><a name="output">OUTPUT</a></h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong><strong>output_file</strong></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This file reports the calculated statistics for all genes/transcripts. It is written as a matrix with row and column names. The row names are the genes'/transcripts' names. The column names are for the reported statistics.</p>
<p>If there are only 2 different conditions among the samples, four statistics (columns) will be reported for each gene/transcript. They are &quot;PPEE&quot;, &quot;PPDE&quot;, &quot;PostFC&quot; and &quot;RealFC&quot;. &quot;PPEE&quot; is the posterior probability (estimated by EBSeq) that a gene/transcript is equally expressed. &quot;PPDE&quot; is the posterior probability that a gene/transcript is differentially expressed. &quot;PostFC&quot; is the posterior fold change (condition 1 over condition2) for a gene/transcript. It is defined as the ratio between posterior mean expression estimates of the gene/transcript for each condition. &quot;RealFC&quot; is the real fold change (condition 1 over condition2) for a gene/transcript.  It is the ratio of the normalized within condition 1 mean count over normalized within condition 2 mean count for the gene/transcript. Fold changes are calculated using EBSeq's 'PostFC' function. The genes/transcripts are reported in descending order of their &quot;PPDE&quot; values.</p>
<p>If there are more than 2 different conditions among the samples, the output format is different. For differential expression analysis with more than 2 conditions, EBSeq will enumerate all possible expression patterns (on which conditions are equally expressed and which conditions are not). Suppose there are k different patterns, the first k columns of the output file give the posterior probability of each expression pattern is true. Patterns are defined in a separate file, 'output_file.pattern'. The k+1 column gives the maximum a posteriori (MAP) expression pattern for each gene/transcript. The k+2 column gives the posterior probability that not all conditions are equally expressed (column name &quot;PPDE&quot;). The genes/transcripts are reported in descending order of their &quot;PPDE&quot; column values. For details on how EBSeq works for more than 2 conditions, please refer to EBSeq's manual.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="output_file_pattern" class="item"><strong>output_file.pattern</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This file is only generated when there are more than 2 conditions. It defines all possible expression patterns over the conditions using a matrix with names. Each row of the matrix refers to a different expression pattern and each column gives the expression status of a different condition. Two conditions are equally expressed if and only if their statuses are the same.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="output_file_condmeans" class="item"><strong>output_file.condmeans</strong></a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>This file is only generated when there are more than 2 conditions. It gives the normalized mean count value for each gene/transcript at each condition. It is formatted as a matrix with names. Each row represents a gene/transcript and each column represent a condition. The order of genes/transcripts is the same as 'output_file'. This file can be used to calculate fold changes between conditions which users are interested in.</p>

<h1><a name="examples">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p>1) We're interested in isoform-level differential expression analysis and there are two conditions. Each condition has 5 replicates. We have already collected the data matrix as 'IsoMat' and generated ngvector as 'ngvector.ngvec':</p>
<pre>
 rsem-run-ebseq --ngvector ngvector.ngvec IsoMat 5,5 IsoMat.results</pre>
<p>The results will be in 'IsoMat.results'.</p>
<p>2) We're interested in gene-level analysis and there are 3 conditions. The first condition has 3 replicates and the other two has 4 replicates each. The data matrix is named as 'GeneMat':</p>
<pre>
 rsem-run-ebseq GeneMat 3,4,4 GeneMat.results</pre>
<p>Three files, 'GeneMat.results', 'GeneMat.results.pattern', and 'GeneMat.results.condmeans', will be generated.</p>
